* When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Whenever I care about my work :-) Local changes are inherently unsafe. A remote 
backup is always a good idea, as it provides an extra recovery point in case 
something bad happens with the local copy.

Also, whenever I want to access my work from a different machine or share it with 
somebody else, a remote repository is a very good solution.
