* Reflect: Using a remote repository
  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
  work local?
  
Whenever I care about my work :-) Local changes are inherently unsafe. A remote 
backup is always a good idea, as it provides an extra recovery point in case 
something bad happens with the local copy.

Also, whenever I want to access my work from a different machine or share it
with somebody else, a remote repository is a very good solution.



* Reflect: Manual vs. automatic pull
  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
  automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  
Firstly, you want to be aware of the changes, as these might affect your own
work. Secondly, you want control over the moment when you pull changes, so they
would not become a random distraction when you're in the middle of something.
