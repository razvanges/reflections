What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git creates its metadata directory, and is ready to track future changes you'll inform it about. 



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a kind of buffer where you place everything you want to include in the next commit. It's a kind of logical working dir. Compared to the working directory and the repository, it is a logical subset of its files and elements. It's valuable because it allows us to sort out our bigger changes (when we've been not so disciplined :D ) and still create meaningful commits.
